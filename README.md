# Commodore 64 BASIC and Assembly Program Collection

Welcome to my repository of Commodore 64 programs! This collection showcases the creativity and possibilities of retro computing, with examples written in both BASIC and Assembly Language.

## File Types
- **` .PRG `**: Precompiled binaries, ready to load and execute seamlessly on Commodore 64 emulators or the original hardware.
- **` .BAS `**: Source code for Commodore BASIC programs. Easily modified directly in a BASIC editor or emulator.
- **` .ASM `**: Assembly Language source code, requiring an assembler.

## How to Use
1. **` .PRG ` Files:**
   - Load these directly into your emulator or C64 system.
2. **` .BAS ` Files:**
   - Open and edit in any BASIC editor, then load to run.
3. **` .ASM ` Files:**
   - Assemble with an assembler and run the output on your C64 or emulator.

## Tools and Requirements
- [VICE Emulator](https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/) for running programs.
- [CBM .prg Studio](https://www.ajordison.co.uk/) for working with Assembly Language files.
