# Commodore 64 BASIC and Assembly Programs

Welcome to my repository of Commodore 64 programs! This collection showcases the creativity and possibilities of retro computing, with examples written in both BASIC and Assembly language.

## File Types
- **` .PRG `**: Executable programs for the C64. Precompiled binaries ready to load and execute on emulators or real hardware (requires disk/other media transfer for real hardware).
- **` .BAS `**: Source code for Commodore BASIC programs. Easily modified directly in a text editor or IDE.
- **` .ASM `**: Source code for C64 (6502) assembly programs. Easily modified directly in a text editor or IDE. Requires an assembler.

## How to Use
1. **` .PRG ` Files:**
   - Load these directly into your emulator or a real C64 system and `RUN`.
2. **` .BAS ` Files:**
   - Open/edit in a text editor, then enter into an emulator or a real C64 system and `RUN`.
3. **` .ASM ` Files:**
   - Assemble into a .prg with an assembler, then load into an emulator or a real C64 system and `RUN`.

## Tools and Requirements
- [VICE Emulator](https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/) for running programs.
- [CBM .prg Studio](https://www.ajordison.co.uk/) for working with Assembly Language files.
